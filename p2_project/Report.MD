# Project 2: Investigating a dataset (Titanic): What factors made people more likely to survive?

Questions before starting:

* What factors made people more likely to survive?

How to test hypothesis?

* Calculate the correlation between the chosen factors and the survivability.

Exploration:

The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

* Make a Pie chart break down male-female survivability
* Show scatterplots when investigating correlation
